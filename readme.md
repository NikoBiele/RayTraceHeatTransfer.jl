# RayTraceHeatTransfer.jl

Enclosure radiative heat transfer in Julia.

Notice: This repository is still under development and breaking changes may occur.

## Documentation

The documentation of this package will gradually be rolled out in an online book format [here](https://radiative-transfer.org/).

## References

This repository is built on novel and original analytic solution methods to the radiative transfer equation.
Additionally this repository was inspired in part by [this book](https://www.routledge.com/Thermal-Radiation-Heat-Transfer/Howell-Menguc-Daun-Siegel/p/book/9780367347079).

## Authors

The primary author, developer and maintainer of this repository is Nikolaj Maack Bielefeld.

The functions for calculating 3D view factors analytically were originally written by Jacob A. Kerkhoff and Michael J. Wagner of University of Wisconsin-Madison, Energy Systems Optimization Lab, implementing the method described [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2015.07.131).
